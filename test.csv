Apps  
Surface Book  comes with great built -in apps, and you can find more 
apps in the Windows Store .  
You can also use your favor ite desktop apps on Surface Book .  
Processor  The 6th Gen Intel® Core™ i5 or i7  processor provides the speed and

Set up your Surface Book  
Before you start , make sure a wireless network is available  and you have the network pass word .  
If you have a Microsoft account , use it to set up your Surface Book . A Microsoft account is an email 
address and password you use to sign in to other Microsoft services like Xbox, Outlook.com, 
OneDrive, Skype, or Windows Phone. If you don’t already have a Microsoft account, y ou can create 
one during setup.  
Charge your Surface Book  
1. Connect the two parts of the power cord.  
2. Connect the power cord securely to the charging port on your Surface Book . A light 
appears at the end of the connector when your Surface is getting power.  
 
 
 
3. Plug the power supply into an electrical outlet.  
","  
© 201 6 Microsoft   Page 5 
Set up Windows  
Press the power button to turn on your 
Surface Book .  
Windows starts and guides you through the 
setup process. During setup you’ll connect to a 
wireless network and choose a language, color 
scheme, and name for your Surface.  
For more info, see Set up your Surface  on 
Surface.com.  
 
 
Choose a mode to work in  
You can configure your Surface Book  to suit 
whatever you’re doing at the moment. With 
the Clipboard attached to the full -size backlit 
keyboard, Surface Book  is a high -performance 
laptop.  
 
 
The keyboard attaches to the Clipboard with a friction mechanism. You can detach  the keyboard 
and reattach it in the position you want.  
 
To detach  the keyboard:  
1. Press and hold the Detach key 
 , or select Detach  
 in the taskbar, until the LED on the

© 201 6 Microsoft   Page 6 
With the Clipboard detached from the 
keyboard,  Surface Book  becomes a thin, 
light tablet that works perfectly with 
OneNote and Surface Pen. It even has its 
own battery, giving you several hours of 
use with the keyboard detached.  
 
 
To reattach the keyboard, align the 
keyboard and Clipboard and bring them 
together  until they click into place.  
  
 
Turn the Clipboard around and reattach it 
to use Surface Book  like a creative canvas. 
By reconnecting it to the keyboard, you 
have access to the USB ports  and the  
DisplayPort and you have more battery 
time.  
       
Show your screen to other people in the 
room by attaching the Clipboard to the 
keyboard so you’re looking at the back of 
the Clipboard as you type.  
  
 
","  
© 201 6 Microsoft   Page 7 
Note:   Surface Book  uses battery power to release the Clipboard. If the battery is too low, the 
green light won’t come on and you won’t be able to detach the keyboard from the Clipboard. 
Charge your Surface Book  until you have enough power to disable the friction mechanism.  
The basics  
Here are a few basic things to know about your Surface Book . 
Power and chargin g

hours to charge Surface Book  fully from an empty state. It can take longer if you’re using your 
Surface Book  for power -intensive activities like gaming or video streaming while you’re charging it.  
You can use the USB port on your power supply to charge other devices, like a phone, while your 
Surface Book  charges. Note that the USB port on the power supply is on ly for charging, not for 
data transfer. If you want to use a USB device, plug it into the USB port on your Surface Book .  
Check the battery level  
You can check the battery level from the lock screen or on the desktop.  
 ","
